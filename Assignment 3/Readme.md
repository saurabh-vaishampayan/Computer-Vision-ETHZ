This contains code for Assignment 3. The Assignment comprised of 2 tasks: 

1. Determination of camera parameters from 2D-3D correspondences.
2. Reconstruction of a 3D scene given multiple images of an object.
    a. This first involved code for computing the Essential matrix given images from 2 cameras and computing valid projection matrices for each camera.
    b. Now we set a global reference and compute Projection matrix for each camera.
    c. Perform 3D point triangulation from the projection matrices and image data.
